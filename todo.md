# To Do


- Properly categorise everything

- Figure out what categories to actually use! 
  - Binary hacking / web app testing / infrastructure pentesting etc. are all pretty big areas, use these as main categories?
  - Method: Keep finding and adding stuff until it becomes unmaintainable without categories.
